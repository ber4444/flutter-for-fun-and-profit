Flutter app for Android, made in Dart and Kotlin.

Released on Google Play as Inner Circle Squared.

Was thinking to release it on the App Store too but I'm not paying 100 bucks per year to Apple, and not supporting their walled garden ecosystem by purchasing an Apple device, esp. because it comes with no added value whatsoever.
